In this project I carry out several data analysis on the survey data
to extract any insights, the first step was to carry out a kmean and PCA analysis on the dataset to segment participants

PCA was also applied on the dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset in order to make using it to a model for predicting possible level of interest in "Adrenaline sports" by individuals.
I also tried to understand: given a set of information about the type of music a participant likes, can we find any behavioural pattern for example, participants that responded with a high level of liking horror movies is there a behaviour pattern with regards to their fears or favourite educational subject?
This and many more will made available in this project based time goes on.

For now, we only have the segmentation data analysis and a few insights with regards to favorites music and movie type.
