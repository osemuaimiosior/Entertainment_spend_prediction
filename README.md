In this project I carry out several data analysis on the survey data
to extract useful insights, the first step was to carry out a hierarchical clustering & kmean to segment participants.
I also tried to understand: given a set of information about the type of music a participant likes, can we find any behavioural pattern for example, participants that responded with a high level of liking horror movies, is there a behaviour pattern with regards to their fears and/or favourite educational subject?
This and many more will made available in this project as new insights bare found.

Will keep updating this space as I work
